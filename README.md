XML Tools can perform XML and RelaxNG validation and can run XPath queries on XML documents. It does not validate DTDs or XSDs.

This is an updated port of the XML Tools plugin with a focus on Gedit 3 compatability. The original Gtk 2 version by Simon Wenner and Pascal Sachs can be found here: https://launchpad.net/gedit-xmltools

To install this plugin, make sure you have python-lxml installed and then copy these files into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ and restart Gedit. Then activate the plugin through the preferences.
