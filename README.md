XML Tools is a Gedit 3 plugin for performing XML and RelaxNG validation. It can also be used to run XPath queries on an open XML document. It does not validate DTDs or XSDs.

This is an updated port of the plugin with a focus on Gedit 3 compatability. The original Gedit 2 version by Simon Wenner and Pascal Sachs can be found here: https://launchpad.net/gedit-xmltools

To install this plugin, make sure you have python-lxml installed and then copy these files into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ and restart Gedit. Then activate the plugin through the preferences.
